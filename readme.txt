== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does my server support this plugin? =

Most shared hosting providers will support this. You will need PHP 5.3 and either the Open_SSL extension of the mbcrypt function. The plugin needs one of these cryptography functions in order to read the postback from clickbank. Ask you hosting provider to enable this if you don't have it enabled. In addition, you will need to have a account on ClickBank.com and a product to sell.
